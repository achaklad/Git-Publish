Hi,

Thank you for visiting my repo! I am slowly building up my GitHub profile. 

I am a continuous learner, and knock off a bunch of stuff every year; most of which stays in my PKM archive. This repo helps showcase some of the work I have been doing to adapt to the changing industry dynamics. Thanks again for looking at my repo.

Cheers,
